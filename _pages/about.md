I'm a ML engineer/ Data scientist in Vancouver, Canada. My current technical interest is the application of Deep Learning to NLP, especially efficient transformer models, semi-supervised learning and contrastive/deep metric learning. My passions are software engineering, ML and ... dogs. Here is a picture of my dog to brighten your day.
