I'm a ML engineer/ Data scientist in the beautiful Vancouver, Canada. My technical interest is the application of Deep Learning to NLP, especially efficient transformer models, semi-supervised learning and contrastive/deep metric learning. 

My passions are software engineering, machine learning and ... dogs. Here is a picture of my dog to brighten your day :dog:
